Pyglet2-gui is an updated version of [pyglet-gui](https://github.com/jorgecarleitao/pyglet-gui)
for Pyglet v2+ and Python 3.11+.

Pyglet-gui was originally a fork of [Kytten](https://code.google.com/p/kytten/),
but ended up being a new project by its own right since the API changed dramatically.

This project is unlikely to be updated as I needed this for one project.
Refer to pyglet-gui documentation that work 90% of the time.
